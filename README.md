# Astrography ‚Äì Mapping Our Stellar Neighborhood üåå

Astrography is a 3D visualization tool focused on performing astrography‚Äîthe mapping of our local stellar environment. This tool charts stars within 20 light years of the Sun (as of March 2025) and uses density mapping to distinguish ‚Äúseas‚Äù (areas with few stars) from ‚Äúcontinents‚Äù (clusters of stars). It‚Äôs designed to help researchers, educators, and space planners understand our local space geography and assess potential future pathways for exploration and expansion.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Local Focus:**  
  Explore detailed data on stars within a 20 light-year radius using a comprehensive dataset (`complete_data_stars.json`).

- **Dual 3D Views:**  
  - **True Coordinates Map:** Displays stars in their actual 3D positions.  
  - **Globe Map:** Projects the stellar neighborhood onto a rotating sphere for an intuitive overview.

- **Density Mapping:**  
  Visualize regions of high and low star density to identify potential "continents" and "seas" in space.

- **Interactive Exploration:**  
  - **Custom Camera Controls:** Rotate, zoom, and pan using mouse or touch.  
  - **Dynamic Labels & Tooltips:** Click or hover on stars to see detailed information (e.g., star name, distance, spectral type, mass).

- **Advanced Filtering:**  
  Refine your view by filtering stars based on spectral class, brightness, size, and spatial connectivity for in-depth astrographic studies.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- **Browser:** A modern WebGL-compatible browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- **Local Web Server:** Run a local server (e.g., Python‚Äôs `http.server` or similar) to serve the files.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astrography.git
   cd astrography
   ```

2. **Run a Local Server:**

   For example, with Python 3:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Open in Browser:**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to launch Astrography.

## Use Cases üéØ

- **Astrography & Space Geography:**  
  Create a ‚Äúmap‚Äù of our local stellar neighborhood to understand the spatial layout and connectivity of nearby stars.

- **Future Space Planning:**  
  Identify potential routes, obstacles, and clusters that could influence future interstellar exploration and astropolitical strategies.

- **Research & Analysis:**  
  Compare spectral types, brightness, and other stellar parameters in a focused area for targeted astronomical studies.

- **Educational Outreach:**  
  Use the interactive 3D maps as a teaching tool to explain concepts like star density, spectral classification, and spatial distribution in the cosmos.
